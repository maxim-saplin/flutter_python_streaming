In the given code, the client can determine the dimensions of the map in the response by looking at the `HeightMapResponse` message. 

The `HeightMapResponse` message has a field called `height_map` which is defined as a repeated field of type `float`. The number of elements in the `height_map` field will correspond to the dimensions of the map.

For example, if the `height_map` field has 10 elements, it means that the map has a dimension of 10. The client can use the length of the `height_map` field to determine the dimensions of the map in the response.
