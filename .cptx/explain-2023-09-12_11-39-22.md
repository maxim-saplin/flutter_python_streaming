The code you provided is a Protocol Buffers (protobuf) definition file. It defines a service called `NumberSortingService` with a single RPC method called `SortNumbers`. The `SortNumbers` method takes a `NumberArray` message as input and returns a `NumberArray` message as output.

The `NumberArray` message is defined as having a repeated field called `numbers` of type `int32`. This means that it can contain multiple integer values.

The `syntax = "proto3";` line at the beginning of the file specifies that the code is written in the protobuf version 3 syntax.

If you have any specific questions or need further explanation about any part of the code, please let me know.
